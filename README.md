# llvm first

## msvc

One can use llvm/clang in msvc by visual studio, which can refer to [[1]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/clang-support-cmake?view=msvc-170).

## prebuild

### official

Official prebuild can be found at [[2]](https://llvm.org/builds/)[[3]](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html#11.0.0). But it doesn't contain `llvm-config`.
